# Core

- treasure caves
- goblins
- losing
- fullscreen and resizability
- speed up time button
- temporarily pause time button

# Performance

- Just use math to get neighboring tile ids
- underclock cpu
- Use ids for stuff, not positions

# Nitpicks

- Dwarves should move into the tiles they just mined before pathing to other resource tiles

# Refactor

- Function to tell if a tile is moveable or not
- hotreloading
